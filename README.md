## üöÄ Getting Started

### Option 1: Use Online (Recommended)
Visit [https://rluvaton.github.io/multi-dot-viewer/](https://rluvaton.github.io/multi-dot-viewer/) - no installation required!

### Option 2: Run Locally

2. **Open** `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. **Start exploring** with the included sample diagrams

### No setup required! The application runs entirely in the browser.

## üéÆ How to Use

### Loading Diagrams
- Click **"Load DOT Files"** to upload your own `.dot` or `.gv` files
- Select multiple files at once for batch loading
- Sample diagrams load automatically on first visit

### Canvas Navigation
- **Pan**: Click and drag on empty canvas areas
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel or zoom controls (+/- buttons)
- **Drag Diagrams**: Click and drag diagram containers to reposition
- **Reset View**: Return to default zoom and position

### Diagram Selection & Visibility
- **Checkboxes**: Control which diagrams are visible
- **Canvas Click**: Click diagrams to select without focusing
- **Sidebar Click**: Click diagram names to select and focus
- **Select All/Unselect All**: Bulk selection controls
- **Select Top Graphs**: Automatically select only top-level diagrams

### Connection Analysis
- **Shared Labels**: Gray dashed lines show diagrams with common labels
- **Subset Relationships**: Red arrows indicate when one diagram is a subset of another
- **Connection Visibility**: Toggle between "All", "Subset Only", or "None"
- **Filter Options**: Hide connections with few shared labels or transitive relationships

### Advanced Features
- **Delete Unselected**: Remove all unchecked diagrams at once
- **Delete Non-Top Graphs**: Remove all subset diagrams, keeping only comprehensive ones
- **Relayout**: Reorganize diagrams alphabetically with proper spacing

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl/Cmd + 0`: Reset view to default
- `Ctrl/Cmd + +`: Zoom in
- `Ctrl/Cmd + -`: Zoom out
- `Ctrl/Cmd + F`: Fit all visible diagrams in view

## üîó Connection Analysis

The application automatically analyzes relationships between diagrams:

### Shared Label Connections
- **Detection**: Identifies common node/edge labels between diagrams
- **Visualization**: Gray dashed lines with shared count labels
- **Filtering**: Hide connections below a minimum threshold

### Subset Relationships
- **Smart Detection**: Recognizes when all labels from one diagram exist in another
- **Hierarchy Visualization**: Red arrows pointing from comprehensive to subset diagrams
- **Transitive Filtering**: Option to hide indirect relationships (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC hides A‚ÜíC)

### Performance Optimization
- **Connection Caching**: Efficient O(1) lookups for relationship data
- **Smart Updates**: Only recalculates when diagrams change, not during visibility changes
- **Auto-Hide**: Connections automatically hidden when >10 diagrams are loaded

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies (CDN)
- **D3.js v7**: Canvas interactions, zoom/pan, data binding
- **Graphviz WASM**: WebAssembly DOT rendering engine
- **d3-graphviz**: SVG generation from DOT syntax
- **dotparser**: Accurate DOT syntax parsing for label extraction

### Architecture Highlights
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Main `MultiDotViewer` class with clean separation of concerns
- **Event-Driven**: Efficient event handling with proper cleanup
- **Performance Optimized**: Lazy rendering, connection caching, efficient DOM updates

## üé® Sample DOT Files

Includes three demonstration diagrams:

1. **Simple Graph**: Basic directed graph with cycles
2. **Complex Workflow**: Multi-step process with decision points
3. **Network Diagram**: Undirected graph showing system connections

### Example DOT Syntax
```dot
digraph Example {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue];
    edge [color=gray];
    
    Start -> Process1 [label="initialize"];
    Process1 -> Decision [label="evaluate"];
    Decision -> Process2 [label="Yes"];
    Decision -> End [label="No"];
    Process2 -> End [label="complete"];
}

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### For Large Diagram Sets
- Use "Select Top Graphs" to focus on comprehensive diagrams
- Enable connection filtering to reduce visual complexity
- Consider splitting very large DOT files into logical components
- Use "Delete Non-Top Graphs" to remove redundant subset diagrams

### Memory Management
- The application uses lazy rendering to minimize memory usage
- Only visible diagrams consume rendering resources
- Connection caching prevents redundant calculations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Diagrams not rendering**
- Verify DOT syntax is valid using `dot -T svg file.dot`
- Check browser console for WebAssembly errors
- Ensure files are actual DOT format, not just renamed text files

**Performance issues**
- Try "Hide Connections" if you have many diagrams
- Use "Select Top Graphs" to focus on essential diagrams
- Consider breaking very large DOT files into smaller components

**Connection analysis problems**
- Connections are based on exact label matching
- Node and edge labels must be identical (case-sensitive)
- Use "Minimum Shared Labels" filter to reduce noise

**Mobile/responsive issues**
- Sidebar collapses automatically on small screens
- Touch gestures supported for pan/zoom
- Some features may be limited on very small screens
